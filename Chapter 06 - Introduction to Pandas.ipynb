But, what if you want to select a specific number of rows and specific columns? Certainly, you can combine both methods as code 3.2. presents. Even though this might seem correct, there are some limitations, specially considering pandas does not know what the type of data is contain in a DataFrame. For this reason, for production code it's always (highly / must) recommended to use the <strong>.iloc()</strong> and <strong>loc()</strong> pandas optimized access methods. Both methods (iloc and loc) accomplish the same results. However, one of them might fit better for certain situations you will encounter in the future.\n",

    "DataFrames can also be exported out of Pythons environment. Similar to import a file into pandas, you can export a DataFrame to multiple data sources. The methods <strong>to_excel( )</strong> and <strong>to_csv( )</strong> have several optional arguments that you can find in its documentations. When you export a DataFrame to excel or csv, pandas will automatically create a new column containing the dataset's index values (135, 167, 231, 515, 643), even if an index already exists. For now, this behavior might not affect your process or seems not important. However, it is extremely valuable in situations when the data has been divided into various parts as it supports to keep track of its original indexes. To remove this column, just set the optional argument <strong>index</strong> to False.\n",
